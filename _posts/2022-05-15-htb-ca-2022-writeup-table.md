|Kryptos Support|★☆☆☆|The secret vault used by the Longhir's planet<br /> council, Kryptos, contains some very<br /> sensitive state secrets that Virgil and<br /> Ramona are after to prove the injustice<br /> performed by the commission. Ulysses<br /> performed an initial recon at their request<br /> and found a support portal for the vault. Can<br /> you take a look if you can infiltrate this system?||[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#kryptos-support)<br>[Hansuuuuuuuuuu](https://github.com/Hansuuuuuuuuuu/CTF_Writeups/blob/master/Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022/web_1_kryptossupport.md#web-1-kryptos-support)<br>[Almond Force (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n-RTUDUrW0)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0eNRGY_nb0)<br>[skyfr](https://skyfr.notion.site/Kryptos-Support-6d5b8999ece5473ab6bbc47a061a9e64)<br>[meispi](https://meispi.github.io/posts/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/#kryptos-support-web)|
|BlinkerFluids|★☆☆☆|Once known as an imaginary liquid used in<br /> automobiles to make the blinkers work is<br /> now one of the rarest fuels invented on<br /> Klaus' home planet Vinyr. The Golden Fang<br /> army has a free reign over this miraculous<br /> fluid essential for space travel thanks to the<br /> Blinker Fluids™ Corp. Ulysses has infiltrated<br /> this supplier organization's one of the HR<br /> department tools and needs your help to get<br /> into their server.

|Amidst Us|★☆☆☆|The AmidstUs tribe is a notorious group of<br /> sleeper agents for hire. We have plausible<br /> reasons to believe they are working with<br /> Draeger, so we have to take action to<br /> uncover their identities. Ulysses and bonnie<br /> have infiltrated their HQ and came across<br /> this mysterious portal on one of the<br /> unlocked computers. Can you hack into it<br /> despite the low visibility and get them<br /> access?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p9012jryfu1zx2c/web_amidst_us.zip?dl=0)|[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#amidst-us)<br>[Almond Force (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ViLZ03vcew)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/amidst-us)|
|Intergalactic Post|★☆☆☆|The biggest intergalactic newsletter agency<br /> has constantly been spreading<br /> misinformation about the energy crisis war.<br /> Bonnie's sources confirmed a hostile<br /> takeover of the agency took place a few<br /> months back, and we suspect the Golden<br /> Fang army is behind this. Ulysses found us a<br /> potential access point to their agency<br /> servers. Can you hack their newsletter<br /> subscribe portal and get us entry?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rg5dphmbz855wa4/web_intergalactic_post.zip?dl=0)|[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#intergalactic-post)|
|Acnologia Portal|★★☆☆|Bonnie has confirmed the location of the<br />Acnologia spacecraft operated by the<br /> Golden Fang mercenary. Before taking over<br /> the spaceship, we need to disable its security<br /> measures. Ulysses discovered an accessible<br /> firmware management portal for the<br /> spacecraft. Can you help him get in?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3yy4dmqumba1zcm/web_acnologia_portal.zip?dl=0)|[pich4ya](https://gist.github.com/pich4ya/fa26c091c989db14234b2f9aa81fedbc)|
|Spiky Tamagotchy|★★☆☆|Captain Spiky comes from a rare species of<br /> creatures who can only breathe underwater.<br /> During the energy-crisis war, he was captured<br /> as a war prisoner and later forced to be a<br /> Tamagotchi pet for a child of a general of<br /> nomadic tribes. He is forced to react in specific<br /> ways and controlled remotely purely for the<br /> amusement of the general's children. The<br /> Paraman crew needs to save the captain of his<br /> misery as he is potentially a great asset for the<br /> war against Draeger. Can you hack into the<br /> Tamagotchi controller to rescue the captain?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lu7nit275ggtu8o/web_spiky_tamagotchi.zip?dl=0)||
|Red Island|★★☆☆|The Red Island of the glowing sea is a proud<br /> tribe of species that can only see red colors.<br /> Hence every physical item, picture, and poster<br /> on this island is masked with red colors. The<br /> Golden Fang army took advantage of the color<br /> weakness of the species of Red Island to<br /> smuggle illegal goods in and out of the island<br /> behind the ministry's back. Without an<br /> invitation, it's impossible to get entry to the<br /> island. So we need to hack the ministry and<br /> send us an invite from the inside to stop the<br /> atrocities of Draeger's men on this island. As<br /> always, Ulysses, with his excellent recon skills,<br /> got us access to one of the portals of the Red<br /> Island ministry. Can you gain access to their<br /> networks through this portal?|||
|Mutation Lab|★★☆☆|One of the renowned scientists in the research<br /> of cell mutation, Dr. Rick, was a close ally of<br /> Draeger. The by-products of his research, the<br /> mutant army wrecked a lot of havoc during<br /> the energy-crisis war. To exterminate the<br /> leftover mutants that now roam over the<br /> abandoned areas on the planet Vinyr, we need<br /> to acquire the cell structures produced in Dr.<br /> Rick's mutation lab. Ulysses managed to find a<br /> remote portal with minimal access to Dr. Rick's<br /> virtual lab. Can you help him uncover the<br /> experimentations of the wicked scientist?||[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#mutation-lab)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2dZ0Pjn1aY)<br>[skyfr](https://skyfr.notion.site/Mutation-lab-b05ae8c0f0f64fe2b06e36c93debd8f6)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/mutation-lab)|
|Genesis Wallet|★★★☆|To weaken the Golden Fang army, we must cut<br /> off their funding of the Genesis coins. Ulysses<br /> managed to perform a phishing attack against<br /> one of the financial operators of the<br /> mercenary and retrieved the login credentials<br /> "icarus:FlyHighToTheSky" for the Genesis<br /> wallet. However, the account is protected with<br /> 2FA. Can you hack into this renowned<br /> intergalactic wallet and move their funds to<br /> your account?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jy97gy4yan82pix/web_genesis_wallet.zip?dl=0)|[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#genesis-wallet)<br>[pich4ya](https://gist.github.com/pich4ya/0db024271327c6abc3a96b986d2c781a)|
|Genesis Wallet's Revenge|★★★☆|The previous attempts to get access to the<br /> financial operator's account of the Golden<br /> Fang army failed, and the Genesis platform<br /> went under heavy security modifications to<br /> patch any potential issues it might have.<br /> Luckily, the operator's credentials remained<br /> the same "icarus:FlyHighToTheSky". Can you<br /> bypass the 2FA protection and hack into the<br /> wallet account of that operator to drain his<br /> balance?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dweolarpmkwhkyx/web_genesis_wallet_redemption.zip?dl=0)||
|CheckpointBots|★★★☆|The evergreen Earth was seized by the<br /> nomadic tribes of the Glowing Sea during the<br /> energy crisis war that turned beautiful Japan<br /> into a war-torn autonomous region of<br /> militarized activities. Even after Draeger's<br /> defeat, the once proud nation of Japan was<br /> still under the captivity of the nomadic tribes<br /> and is currently at war with other regions. At<br /> the request of the Earth liberation front,<br /> Ulysses and the crew decided to help infiltrate<br /> their headquarters in the Kyoto region. Can<br /> you disarm the Checkpoint bots that roam<br /> around the city of Kyoto?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmyir1x6os8vi6n/web_checkpointbots.zip?dl=0)||

|Space Pirate: Entrypoint|★☆☆☆|D12 is one of Golden Fang's missile launcher spaceships. Our mission as space pirates is to highjack D12, get inside the control panel room, and access the missile launcher system. To achieve our goal, we split the mission into three parts. In this part, all we need to do is bypass the scanning system and open the gates so that we proceed further.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8girldorupgrufp/pwn_sp_entrypoint.zip?dl=0)|[siunam321](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/tree/main/Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022/Pwn/Space-Pirate:Entrypoint)<br>[skyfr](https://skyfr.notion.site/Space-pirate-Entrypoint-ebd8341824cf40c2ae5f86d6adfab677)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/entrypoint)|
|Space pirate: Going Deeper|★☆☆☆|We are inside D12! We bypassed the scanning system, and now we are right in front of the Admin Panel. The problem is that there are some safety mechanisms enabled so that not everyone can access the admin panel and become the user right below Draeger. Only a few of his intergalactic team members have access there, and they are the mutants that Draeger trusts. Can you disable the mechanisms and take control of the Admin Panel?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jqcewa7fp8se8ge/pwn_sp_going_deeper.zip?dl=0)|[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/going-deeper)<br>[pizzapablo666](https://pizzapablo666.github.io/Writeups-CyberApo22/)|
|Space pirate: Retribution|★☆☆☆|We got access to the Admin Panel! The last part of the mission is to change the target location of the missiles. We can probably target Draeger's HQ or some other Golden Fang's spaceships. Draeger's HQ might be out of the scope for now, but we can certainly cause significant damage to his army.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k6f2synfgve5j1y/pwn_sp_retribution.zip?dl=0)||
|Vault-breaker|★☆☆☆|Moneymaker, Big Boy Bonnie has a crew of his own to do his dirty jobs. On a tiny little planet a few lightyears away, a custom-made vault has been found by his crew. Something is hidden inside it, can you find out the way it works and bring it to Bonnie?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/osynv9ln7hcb8b5/pwn_vault_breaker.zip?dl=0)||
|Fleet Management|★☆☆☆|Reading through an Underground Intergalactic hacking forum Bonnie stumbles upon a post talking about a backdoor in the Gold Fang’s Spaceship Fleet Management System. There is a note about a twist added by the author to prevent anyone from using the backdoor. Will Bonnie achieve to gain access to Gold Fang’s internal network and retrieve precious documents?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ftt6c9q1obkutcy/pwn_fleet_management.zip?dl=0)||
|Hellbound|★★☆☆|In one of Bonnie's first missions, a helpless dog was injured by the laser guns during the fierce fight and was unable to move and escape the war scene. Bonnie took the dog and fled the battle, but not much he could do to help the poor dog. Some of the crew's doctors and engineers, made some mutations and added artificial parts to the dog, making it a living war machine under Bonnie's control. After the last fight, something hit the manufactured parts, making them malfunction and driving the dog berserk. Can you fix them and make the dog loyal under Bonnie's control again?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvk3mik7frz8dfi/pwn_hellhound.zip?dl=0)||
|Bon-nie-appetit|★★☆☆|After the successful hijacking of the D12 spaceship during the Space Pirate mission, the crew managed to place a signal transmitter on a vending machine that the Golden Fang's members are using to order food from the Supplier Spacecraft of Draeger. Golden Fang's crew's favorite food contains a secret ingredient called "Little Green People", which we do not have further info about. The signal passes through many satellites before it reaches the Supplier, so it won't be easy to track the device and the leaked signal. Can you take advantage of it and get control of the Supplier?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5m5zuqldm1swpwl/pwn_bon_nie_appetit.zip?dl=0)||
|Trick or Deal|★★☆☆|Bonnie and his crew arrive on planet Longhir to get equipped with the latest weaponry, but the intergalactic weapon dealer refuses to sell them weapons because he has a trade agreement with Draeger, the Alien Overlord, thus Bonnie has to employ his neat exploitation tricks to persuade the dealer into selling them weapons.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dm2kap4rg7s2etk/pwn_trick_or_deal.zip?dl=0)||
|Sabotage|★★★☆|Draeger ordered Thanatos, the destroyer under the Golden Fang flag, to annihilate our defense base with a super laser beam capable of destroying whole planets. Bonnie and his crew go for a sabotage-suicide mission in order to stop Thanatos before it's too late.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sfgx6ma40e34hrc/pwn_sabotage.zip?dl=0)||
|Once and for all|★★★☆|This is the final countdown, our last chance to face the evil galaxy overlord Draeger. No mistakes are allowed, we need to give it everything we have to build the finest, most powerful weapon ever made to defeat him. Bonnie assembled his crew to discuss and craft it with every resource possible. Will we manage to make it?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tt0e6ffdt15lt4j/pwn_once_and_for_all.zip?dl=0)||

|Android-in-the-Middle|★☆☆☆|Years have passed since Miyuki rescued you from the graveyard. When Virgil tells you that he needs your help with something he found there, desperate thoughts about your father and the disabilities you developed due to the disposal process come to mind. The device looks like an advanced GPS with AI capabilities. Riddled with questions about the past, you are pessimistic that you could be of any value. After hours of fiddling and observing the power traces of this strange device, you and Virgil manage to connect to the debugging interface and write an interpreter to control the signals. The protocol looks familiar to you. Your father always talked about implementing this scheme in devices for security reasons. Could it have been him?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xv26xze9noe7urd/crypto_android-in-the-middle.zip?dl=0)|[kisanakkkkk](https://github.com/kisanakkkkk/writeup/blob/main/Cyber%20Apocalypse%20CTF%202022/Android-in-the-Middle/Android-in-the-Middle.md)<br>[Tell No Tales](https://tellnotales.xyz/posts/ca2022_htb_writeup/#android-in-the-middle)<br>[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#category-challenge-1-android-in-the-middle)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-android-in-the-middle)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooLw4MlgY3w)|
|Jenny From The Block|★☆☆☆|Intrigued by the fact that you have found something your father made, and with much confidence that you can be useful to the team, you rush excitedly to integrate “Jenny” into the spaceship’s main operating system. For weeks, everything went smoothly, until you ran into a meteor storm. Having little to no data of training, the AI is now malfunctioning. Ulysses freaks out because he can no longer control the spaceship due to the AI overriding his manual commands. Big banging noises terrify your crew members. Everything is shaking. It’s time to act. Do you think you can temporarily shut down “Jenny” until she becomes more sophisticated?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uva8o5gox99h711/crypto_jenny_from_the_block.zip?dl=0)|[Tell No Tales](https://tellnotales.xyz/posts/ca2022_htb_writeup/#jenny-from-the-block)<br>[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-2-jenny-from-the-block)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-jenny-from-the-block)|
|The Three-Eyed Oracle|★☆☆☆|Feeling very frustrated for getting excited about the AI and not thinking about the possibility of it malfunctioning, you blame the encryption of your brain. Feeling defeated and ashamed to have put Miyuki, who saved you, in danger, you slowly walk back to the lab. More determined than ever to find out what’s wrong with your brain, you start poking at one of its chips. This chip is linked to a decision-making algorithm based on human intuition. It seems to be encrypted… but some errors pop up when certain user data is entered. Is there a way to extract more information and fix the chip?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6a4smn70yg0yxfm/crypto_the_three-eyed_oracle.zip?dl=0)|[Tell No Tales](https://tellnotales.xyz/posts/ca2022_htb_writeup/#the-three-eyed-oracle)<br>[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-3-the-three-eyed-oracle)|
|How The Columns Have Turned|★☆☆☆|A day before the memorial of the Dying Sun, Miyuki began talking about Broider, a death squad commander and a friend of Paulie’s capturer. He would be a party guest at Viryr’s palace. After examining a lot of different scenarios, Miyuki came up with a plan in which Paulie would lure Broider to a secluded location so the group could capture him. Following the plan, a wild chase had just begun when the two looked each other in the eye. After an extremely risky maneuver, Paulie outwitted Broider and led him into an alley in Vinyr’s undercity. The plan was a success. Your squad had managed to capture Broider and bring him back to the ship. After hours of interrogation by Ulysses, he revealed the final key to a series of encrypted messages. Can you find a way to decrypt the others? The flag consists entirely of uppercase characters and has the form HTB{SOMETHINGHERE}. You still have to add the {} yourself.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nrn6804945btuzo/crypto_how_the_columns_have_turned.zip?dl=0)|[Tell No Tales](https://tellnotales.xyz/posts/ca2022_htb_writeup/#how-the-columns-have-turned)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-how-the-columns-have-turned)<br>[C4rm3l0](https://carmelos.medium.com/htb-cyber-apocalypse-22-how-the-columns-have-turned-writeup-c2183b76b71a)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMRIYqm0gxw)|
|MOVs Like Jagger|★★☆☆|While following the breadcrumbs from the secret messages you managed to recover from Broider, Bonnie gathered more information from his well trusted “Tsirakia” and found out that the messages were about the destinations of a STS (Space Transportation Ship). The STS, named “Paketo”, is a notoriously large spaceship that transports military supplies for the Golden Fang mercenary army. After spending some time observing the seemingly random trajectory of Paketo, you and Paulie manually plotted the delivery locations and realized that the STS’s orbit forms an elliptic curve. Your spaceship’s advanced technology GPS has calculated the exact parameters of the curve. Can you somehow predict Paketo’s final destination and hijack it?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zzbvzlckg6xke3/crypto_movs_like_jagger.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-4-movs-like-jagger)|
|Find Marher's Secret|★★☆☆|After figuring out the destination of Paketo, Ulysses devised a hijacking plan to sabotage the delivery of the military equipment. Despite efforts, the plan did not work as expected and a battle ensued. Since your movement was restricted, Miyuki ordered you to hide behind a huge container with unknown contents in fear of taking more damage. Seeing all the killings of the manipulated cyborgs (code named: Marher) brought back memories of your time on the graveyard planet. Suddenly, a cyborg appeared in front of you. Unable to move from the shock, death was all you could think about. Fortunately, Ulysses manages to save you at the last second by knocking the cyborg unconscious. You bring it back to the laboratory to use some of its functionalities to repair parts of your brain. You discover that all of its components are encrypted. Can you find a way to extract the secret key?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/it5fky04os848wy/crypto_find_marhers_secret.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-5-find-marhers-secret)|
|Memory Acceleration|★★☆☆|While everyone was asleep, you were pushing the capabilities of your technology to the max. Night after night, you frantically tried to repair the encrypted parts of your brain, reversing custom protocols implemented by your father, wanting to pinpoint exactly what damage had been done and constantly keeping notes because of your inability of forming new memories. On one of those nights, you had a flashback. Your father had always talked about a new technology and how it would change the galaxy. You realized that he had used it on you. This technology dealt with a proof of a work function and decentralized networks. Along with Virgil’s help, you had a “Eureka!” moment, but his approach, brute forcing, meant draining all your energy. Can you find a quicker way to validate new memory blocks?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/01bi7ss1o66w10r/crypto_memory_acceleration.zip?dl=0)|[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-memory-acceleration)|
|Down the Rabinhole|★★☆☆|Miyuki, wanting to find out more evidence about Draeger and his escape, planned a space trip to the maximum security black hole where Draeger was held captive. Problems though soon arose as the approach to the black hole caused distortions on your electronics. Memories of the traumatic experience you had when the Council guards brutally ripped you from your father’s hands painfully flooded your mind. The one thing you never forgot was the signal he sent you while you were still within range of the planet. Only two packets got through, but since they were encrypted you couldn’t figure out what they were. Now, being more determined than ever to find your father, having gained experience during the missions with the squad, you know that it’s time to decrypt the signal.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zu986hqboi4e82r/crypto_down_the_rabinhole.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-6-down-the-rabin-hole)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-down-the-rabinhole)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skjKkZ5i8hQ)|
|Mind In The Clouds|★★★☆|Mysterious kidnappings of Longhir’s best scientists began to occur ever since Draeger gained influence in the council, a fact known to everyone in the troupe. Virgil was certain that these kidnappings had something to do with Meiro and the neuro-linked technology he helped develop. He also knew that Draeger wanted to experiment by uploading minds to the cloud and then connecting them to androids. These thoughts ran through Miyuki’s mind while she was searching for clues in the prison. After finding no signs that indicated a physical escape, she concluded that Draeger hadn’t actually escaped. Instead, he had somehow initiated a backup version of his mind, which he had downloaded into an unknown body. Upon hearing Miyuki’s conclusions, the team was in a rather charged mood. As you sit in the corner, almost paralyzed by the crippling news, you can only think of one thing: Is your father in the cloud/s too?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8d3y8j1pb0ifupr/crypto_mind_in_the_clouds.zip?dl=0)|[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-mind-in-the-clouds)|
|One Step Closer|★★★☆|Reading out loud Danbeer’s thoughts from the cloud server shocked everyone. Knowing that your father has become a consciousness that can be easily turned off and on is traumatizing. You are overwhelmed by your feelings and angry at yourself. You begin to ask yourself. Why am I feeling so much pain? Is there a part of my brain that is still encrypted? Have I screwed up again? You run towards the lab while shouting and slamming the doors behind you. Upon seeing that, Ulysses immediately flees the spaceship. Many days have passed and you are still obsessed with finding the part of your brain that needs to be repaired. Your comrades are startled by your sudden introversion and worry about Ulysses, who is nowhere to be seen. Weeks have passed and Ulysses is still missing. Suddenly, the ship receives a docking signal and as you scan the alien spacecraft for signs of life, a male passenger is discovered. It’s Ulysses! Excited, he rushes out of his capsule and overtakes the crew members, that longed to hug him to get to your lab. Ulysses informs you that he has managed to steal one of the cloud backup servers from the facility where the experiments took place. It seems that this device alters the consciousness of each test subject. Stunned by this information, a realization comes to mind. You are going to get your father back.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhoeklo13u0yzfn/crypto_one_step_closer.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-7-one-step-closer)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-one-step-closer)|

|Rebuilding|★☆☆☆|You arrive on a barren planet, searching for the hideout of a scientist involved in the Longhir resistance movement. You touch down at the mouth of a vast cavern, your sensors picking up strange noises far below. All around you, ancient machinery whirrs and spins as strange sigils appear and change on the walls. You can tell that this machine has been running since long before you arrived, and will continue long after you're gone.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|Puppeteer|★☆☆☆|Planet Longhir is known for it's top-tier researchers. Due to their dedication in science and engineering, their military equipment is the most advanced one in the galaxy. In fact, the prototype DES-3000, a self-propelled precision-strike missile that is capable of reaching targets even in Ratnik galaxy, is being used to disable Galactic Federation's communication satellites. The mystery that Miyuki is trying to solve is, how the satellite's location was leaked since it is a top-sercret that only Galactic Federation's council is aware of. Help her analyse the Council's HQ event logs and solve this mystery.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vm1hb8otmuq7p5/forensics_puppeteer.zip?dl=0)|[Almond Force (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uNByDGiipM)<br>[luhko](https://github.com/luhko/CTF/blob/main/Cyber%20Apocalypse%20CTF%202022/Cyber_Apocalypse_CTF_2022.pdf)<br>[serioton](https://serioton.notion.site/Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022-Writeups-697a1cdda1e44caf894834d98da5cbf2)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/puppeteer)<br>[kevintk1](https://kevintk1.medium.com/cyber-apolcalypse-2022-ctf-ee2c09b43ac#1feb)|
|Golden Persistence|★☆☆☆|Emergency! A space station near Urkir was compromised. Although Urkir is considered to be the very embodiment of the neutral state, it is rich of fuel substances, something that Dreager is very much interested in. Thus, there are now fears that the intergalactic war will also affect this neutral planet. If Draeger and his mercenaries manage to maintain unauthorised access in Urkir's space station and escalate their privileges, they will soon be able to activate the station's defence mechanisms that are able to prevent any spaceship from entering Urkir's airspace. For now, the infected machine is isolated until the case is closed. Help Miyuki find their persistence mechanisms so they cannot gain access again.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xpm3i1hjh82a0tg/forensics_golden_persistence.zip?dl=0)|[Hansuuuuuuuuuu](https://github.com/Hansuuuuuuuuuu/CTF_Writeups/blob/master/Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022/forensics_2_golden_persistence.md#forensics-2-golden-persistence)<br>[Almond Force (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ_AWREHvyM)<br>[luhko](https://github.com/luhko/CTF/blob/main/Cyber%20Apocalypse%20CTF%202022/Cyber_Apocalypse_CTF_2022.pdf)<br>[serioton](https://serioton.notion.site/Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022-Writeups-697a1cdda1e44caf894834d98da5cbf2)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/golden-persistence)<br>[kevintk1](https://kevintk1.medium.com/cyber-apolcalypse-2022-ctf-ee2c09b43ac#b422)|
|Intergalactic Recovery|★☆☆☆|Miyuki's team stores all the evidence from important cases in a shared RAID 5 disk. Especially now that the case IMW-1337 is almost completed, evidences and clues are needed more than ever. Unfortunately for the team, an electromagnetic pulse caused by Draeger's EMP cannon has partially destroyed the disk. Can you help her and the rest of team recover the content of the failed disk?

|Automation|★★☆☆|Vinyr's threat intelligence is monitoring closely all APT groups from every possible galaxy, especially the most dangerous one, longhir. As stated by an anonymous threat intelligence officer, the malicious actors tend to automate their initial post-exploitation enumeration so they can have less on-keyboard time. You can find such an example in the provided network capture generated by a recent incident. Analyse it and find out what they are up to.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2bijhzjh350dlr3/forensics_automation.zip?dl=0)|[Almond Force (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QuYQR2Lai8)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/automation)<br>[kevintk1](https://kevintk1.medium.com/cyber-apolcalypse-2022-ctf-ee2c09b43ac#a0f5)|
|Free Services|★★☆☆|Intergalactic Federation stated that it managed to prevent a large-scale phishing campaign that targeted all space personnel across the galaxy. The enemy's goal was to add as many spaceships to their space-botnet as possible so they can conduct distributed destruction of intergalactic services (DDOIS) using their fleet. Since such a campaign can be easily detected and prevented, malicious actors have changed their tactics. As stated by officials, a new spear phishing campaign is underway aiming high value targets. Now Klaus asks your opinion about a mail it received from "sales@unlockyourmind.gal", claiming that in their galaxy it is possible to recover it's memory back by following the steps contained in the attached file.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f582kwywmnpgq3m/forensics_free_services.zip?dl=0)|[kevintk1](https://kevintk1.medium.com/cyber-apolcalypse-2022-ctf-ee2c09b43ac#c2d1)|
|Seized|★★★☆|Miyuki is now after a newly formed ransomware division which works for Longhir. This division's goal is to target any critical infrastructure and cause financial losses to their opponents. They never restore the encrypted files, even if the victim pays the ransom. This case is the number one priority for the team at the moment. Miyuki has seized the hard-drive of one of the members and it is believed that inside of which there may be credentials for the Ransomware's Dashboard. Given the AppData folder, can you retrieve the wanted credentials?

|Precious Guidance|★★★☆|Miyuki has come across what seems to be a suspicious process running on one of her spaceship's navigation systems. After investigating the origin of this process, it seems to have been initiated by a script called "SatelliteGuidance.vbs". Eventually, one of your engineers informs her that she found this file in the spaceship's Intergalactic Inbox and thought it was an interactive guide for the ship's satellite operations. She tried to run the file but nothing happened. You and Miyuki start analysing it and notice you don't understand its code... it is obfuscated! What could it be and who could be behind its creation? Use your skills to uncover the truth behind the obfuscation layers.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nvfhm4kgrdoee6/forensics_precious_guidance.zip?dl=0)|[kevintk1](https://kevintk1.medium.com/cyber-apolcalypse-2022-ctf-ee2c09b43ac#7833)|
|Reflection|★★★☆|You and Miyuki have succeeded in dis-empowering Draeger's army in every possible way. Stopped their fuel-supply plan, arrested their ransomware gang, prevented massive phishing campaigns and understood their tactics and techniques in depth. Now it is the time for the final blow. The final preparations are completed. Everyone is in their stations waiting for the signal. This mission can only be successful if you use the element of surprise. Thus, the signal must remain a secret until the end of the operation. During some last-minute checks you notice some weird behaviour in Miyuki's PC. You must find out if someone managed to gain access to her PC before it's too late. If so, the signal must change. Time is limited and there is no room for errors.

|Compressor|★☆☆☆|Ramona's obsession with modifications and the addition of artifacts to her body has slowed her down and made her fail and almost get killed in many missions. For this reason, she decided to hack a tiny robot under Golden Fang's ownership called "Compressor", which can reduce and increase the volume of any object to minimize/maximize it according to the needs of the mission. With this item, she will be able to carry any spare part she needs without adding extra weight to her back, making her fast.

|Matrioshka Brain|★☆☆☆|The possibility of a weapon that alters the very core of the structure of the universe itself is beyond even the wildest imaginations. Or is it? Ramona and Paulie are exeperimenting with concentric Dyson spheres to achieve the impossible, to harvest the energy of an entire quasar in order to create such a weapon. The exepriments showed that five spheres are the optimal solution. Alas, the thermal equilibrium is still a pressing issue they need to figure out. They measure the temperature of each sphere for every minute. Now all that is left is to properly analyze the data and figure out why there are so many thermal inconsistencies|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lj1nv3wa3vqognf/misc_matrioshka_brain.zip?dl=0)|[siunam321](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/tree/main/Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022/Misc/Matrioshka-Brain)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/matrioshka-brain)|
|Fuel Crisis|★☆☆☆|After travelling for too many light years, we managed to reach an uninhabited planet to rest for a while. We got a problem though. Phalcon is running out of fuel and we need to stop at the nearest space station to refuel. The closest one is the B1-4S3D station, where we are unfortunately banned from docking our ship. Our surveillance showed that the station uses two OCR cameras to read the unique ID of each spaceship entering. The first one is used as a validator for the second one. We've managed to find a way to disable the validation process for a split second while our ship passes, but we still need to pass through the second camera. Furthermore, our lead hacker opened a connection with the second camera, which we can use to upload our custom model weights. Try to find a way to change the predictions of the model when we pass through the second gate. Be careful though, the other four spaceships that are in front of us need to be ID'd correctly so no suspicion raises.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ctayubgw9wbkcpw/misc_fuel_crisis.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Misc.md#misc-challenge-1-fuel-crisis)|
|Battle in OrI/On|★★☆☆|The spaceship cruiser has been hit! Ramona must hurry and check if the central system is intact! The enemy must have used electromagnetic wave canons! The spaceship's sensors are going crazy and the autopilot system broke down! There is no chance to turn back the enemy will be waiting... But there is a meteor shower ahead! In order to get through safely, the spaceship's power and consumption need to be balanced. Both the laser canons and the thrusters are vital parts for this... And she has to control them manually! Quickly! Ramona needs to upload a valid configuration file to overwrite the values of all sensors on board. The onboard neural network will verify that the new configuration leads to the required power distribution. Attention! The values of the sensors must be at least 99.99% accurate for this to work! Hurry now, time is running out!|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/751vvgoiw234gwq/misc_battle_in_orion.zip?dl=0)||
|Quantum Engine|★★☆☆|We need to travel to one of Draeger's lair in a galaxy far away from here, to search for any clues that might help us prove how Draeger manipulated her to be his most trustworthy cold-blooded assassin. However, traveling there can be quite difficult since it's flooded with the most state-of-the-art IFGs attack spacecrafts. Should we be able to outspeed them, we might have a chance of making it there in one piece. That is why we came to you. Word on the solar system is that you are one of the best quantum mechanics of the galaxy, which I find odd considering your age. Will you be able to modify Phalcon's acceleration system so no IFG spacecraft can ever catch us?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y4cvo83hnazlfzr/misc_quantum_engine.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Misc.md#misc-challenge-2-quantum-engine)|
|Spaceship Hijack|★★★☆|After the successful mission of Space Pirate, Bonnie ordered Ramona to hijack another spaceship on her own on a stealth mission. She managed to get inside it and had limited access to the central controller. By reverse-engineering the controller, we figured out that it uses a unique set of VM instructions with limited capabilities. Can you help her break out of this VM and gain unlimited access?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xoxnmshmupmbhkk/misc_spaceship_hijack.zip?dl=0)||
|Wormhole Efficiency|★★★☆|After a severe clash with one of Golden Fang's battleships, Ramona's spaceship was damaged, and now it consumes fuel at the triple cost. Can you reach home without running out of fuel? Our best option is to travel through wormholes otherwise, the spaceship will be left wandering in space and become prey to Golden Fang's army.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pl2eeejzepdd98r/misc_wormhole_efficiency.zip?dl=0)||

## Hardware

|Challenge Name|Difficulty|Description|Files|Links|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Space Pulses|★☆☆☆|One of our enhanced radio telescopes captured some weird fluctuations from a nearby star. It was idle for decades due to the fact that it was fully enclosed by a Dyson Sphere but its patterns began to change drastically leading us to believe that someone is controlling part of the megastructure to release energy and send these pulses directed to us in order to transmit a message. They must have known that our equipment can read even the slightest fluctuations.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtsv6xuxg9d93xi/hw_space_pulses.zip?dl=0)||
|Through fire n gates|★☆☆☆|After Ramona helped Virgil escape from the prison they were holding him they had to find a way to flee the planet but all the spaceships were grounded. Luckily they manage to gain access to a hangar with decommissioned escape pods. After some tinkering with the pod's control panel, they managed to attach some probes to it and reverse engineer the proprietary protection circuit but some of it appears to be damaged. The only thing holding them back was finding a way to gain access to the flight control system.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/orvc9b22t5y8ijk/hw_through_fire_n_gates.zip?dl=0)||
|Into the Matrix|★★☆☆|After a long time away it is finally time to get back all the equipment build all those years. While going through the hardware devices to reconfigure or upgrade them one of them seemed a bit off. It appears that someone was toying with a few of the devices, changing and breaking the hard-wired components which resulted in some of them malfunctioning. The status matrix in one of the armor-enhancing weapons seems to display random indications making the weapon selection system unusable. This, combined with the fact that most of the circuitry is now under a hard epoxy resin makes it impossible to reconfigure the hardware connection, thus the only solution is to reverse engineer the current device layout and add an additional circuitry that will work around the current one.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pgu9dq5d10y1hge/hw_into_the_matrix.zip?dl=0)||
|Secret Codes	|★★☆☆|A sudden burst of RF signals started in an attempt to compromise our perimeter security. We intercepted a few of them but our ADC broke during the transformation to a serial signal leaving us with only an analog capture. We need to decode it and find if they are close to finding the correct passcode.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1a3ewydf7133jq/hw_secret_codes.zip?dl=0)|[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#hardware-secret-codes)|
