I realized too late that I had some duplicate descriptions for a couple of the challenges. I'm hosting the files I was able to get on DropBox in case anyone wanted to try the challenges on their own after the fact. I'll add more write-ups as I find them.

|Kryptos Support|★☆☆☆|The secret vault used by the<br /> Longhir's planet council, Kryptos,<br /> contains some very sensitive<br /> state secrets that Virgil and<br /> Ramona are after to prove the<br /> injustice performed by the<br /> commission. Ulysses performed<br /> an initial recon at their request<br /> and found a support portal for<br /> the vault. Can you take a look if<br /> you can infiltrate this system?||[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#kryptos-support)<br>[Hansuuuuuuuuuu](https://github.com/Hansuuuuuuuuuu/CTF_Writeups/blob/master/Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022/web_1_kryptossupport.md#web-1-kryptos-support)<br>[Almond Force (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n-RTUDUrW0)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0eNRGY_nb0)<br>[skyfr](https://skyfr.notion.site/Kryptos-Support-6d5b8999ece5473ab6bbc47a061a9e64)<br>[meispi](https://meispi.github.io/posts/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/#kryptos-support-web)<br>[LazyTitan33](https://github.com/LazyTitan33/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HTB%20-%20CyberApocalypse_2022/Web/Kryptos_Support.md)<br>[s1n1st3r](https://s1n1st3r.gitbook.io/ctf-writeups/htb-cyber-apocalypse-2022/challanges/web-kryptos-support)<br>[hussienmisbah](https://hussienmisbah.github.io/post/kryptos-support/)|
|BlinkerFluids|★☆☆☆|Once known as an imaginary<br /> liquid used in automobiles to<br /> make the blinkers work is now<br /> one of the rarest fuels invented<br /> on Klaus' home planet Vinyr. The<br /> Golden Fang army has a free<br /> reign over this miraculous fluid<br /> essential for space travel thanks<br /> to the Blinker Fluids™ Corp.<br /> Ulysses has infiltrated this<br /> supplier organization's one of<br /> the HR department tools and<br /> needs your help to get into their<br /> server.

|Amidst Us|★☆☆☆|The AmidstUs tribe is a notorious<br /> group of sleeper agents for hire.<br /> We have plausible reasons to<br /> believe they are working with<br /> Draeger, so we have to take<br /> action to uncover their identities.<br /> Ulysses and bonnie have<br /> infiltrated their HQ and came<br /> across this mysterious portal on<br /> one of the unlocked computers.<br /> Can you hack into it despite the<br /> low visibility and get them<br /> access?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p9012jryfu1zx2c/web_amidst_us.zip?dl=0)|[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#amidst-us)<br>[Almond Force (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ViLZ03vcew)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/amidst-us)<br>[LazyTitan33](https://github.com/LazyTitan33/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HTB%20-%20CyberApocalypse_2022/Web/Amidst_Us.md)<br>[GordonOus](https://gordonous-cyberspace.me/htb-cyberapocalypse-2022-web/)|
|Intergalactic Post|★☆☆☆|The biggest intergalactic<br /> newsletter agency has constantly<br /> been spreading misinformation<br /> about the energy crisis war.<br /> Bonnie's sources confirmed a<br /> hostile takeover of the agency<br /> took place a few months back,<br /> and we suspect the Golden Fang<br /> army is behind this. Ulysses<br /> found us a potential access point<br /> to their agency servers. Can you<br /> hack their newsletter subscribe<br /> portal and get us entry?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rg5dphmbz855wa4/web_intergalactic_post.zip?dl=0)|[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#intergalactic-post)|
|Acnologia Portal|★★☆☆|Bonnie has confirmed the<br /> location of the Acnologia<br /> spacecraft operated by the<br /> Golden Fang mercenary. Before<br /> taking over the spaceship, we<br /> need to disable its security<br /> measures. Ulysses discovered an<br /> accessible firmware management<br /> portal for the spacecraft. Can you<br /> help him get in?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3yy4dmqumba1zcm/web_acnologia_portal.zip?dl=0)|[pich4ya](https://gist.github.com/pich4ya/fa26c091c989db14234b2f9aa81fedbc)<br>[GordonOus](https://gordonous-cyberspace.me/htb-cyberapocalypse-2022-web/)<br>[jameslowther](https://jameslowther.com/writeups/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022-intergalactic-chase)|
|Spiky Tamagotchy|★★☆☆|Captain Spiky comes from a rare<br /> species of creatures who can only<br /> breathe underwater. During the<br /> energy-crisis war, he was<br /> captured as a war prisoner and<br /> later forced to be a Tamagotchi<br /> pet for a child of a general of<br /> nomadic tribes. He is forced to<br /> react in specific ways and<br /> controlled remotely purely for<br /> the amusement of the general's<br /> children. The Paraman crew<br /> needs to save the captain of his<br /> misery as he is potentially a great<br /> asset for the war against Draeger.<br /> Can you hack into the<br /> Tamagotchi controller to rescue<br /> the captain?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lu7nit275ggtu8o/web_spiky_tamagotchi.zip?dl=0)|[pich4ya](https://gist.github.com/pich4ya/c033a1d147f8eb0348c10ed1a44fc2dc)|
|Red Island|★★☆☆|The Red Island of the glowing<br /> sea is a proud tribe of species<br /> that can only see red colors.<br /> Hence every physical item,<br /> picture, and poster on this island<br /> is masked with red colors. The<br /> Golden Fang army took<br /> advantage of the color weakness<br /> of the species of Red Island to<br /> smuggle illegal goods in and out<br /> of the island behind the<br /> ministry's back. Without an<br /> invitation, it's impossible to get<br /> entry to the island. So we need<br /> to hack the ministry and send us<br /> an invite from the inside to stop<br /> the atrocities of Draeger's men<br /> on this island. As always, Ulysses,<br /> with his excellent recon skills, got<br /> us access to one of the portals of<br /> the Red Island ministry. Can you<br /> gain access to their networks<br /> through this portal?||[Mattia Codato ](https://www.neteye-blog.com/2022/05/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022-red-island-writeup/)|
|Mutation Lab|★★☆☆|One of the renowned scientists in<br /> the research of cell mutation, Dr.<br /> Rick, was a close ally of Draeger.<br /> The by-products of his research,<br /> themutant army wrecked a lot of<br /> havoc during the energy-crisis<br /> war. To exterminate the leftover<br /> mutants that now roam over the<br /> abandoned areas on the planet<br /> Vinyr, we need to acquire the cell<br /> structures produced in Dr. Rick's<br /> mutation lab. Ulysses managed<br /> to find a remote portal with<br /> minimal access to Dr. Rick's<br /> virtual lab. Can you help him<br /> uncover the experimentations of<br /> the wicked scientist?||[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#mutation-lab)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2dZ0Pjn1aY)<br>[skyfr](https://skyfr.notion.site/Mutation-lab-b05ae8c0f0f64fe2b06e36c93debd8f6)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/mutation-lab)<br>[LazyTitan33](https://github.com/LazyTitan33/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/HTB%20-%20CyberApocalypse_2022/Web/Mutation_Lab.md)<br>[s1n1st3r](https://s1n1st3r.gitbook.io/ctf-writeups/htb-cyber-apocalypse-2022/challanges/web-mutation-lab)|
|Genesis Wallet|★★★☆|To weaken the Golden Fang<br /> army, we must cut off their<br /> funding of the Genesis coins.<br /> Ulysses managed to perform a<br /> phishing attack against one of<br /> the financial operators of the<br /> mercenary and retrieved the<br /> login credentials<br /> "icarus:FlyHighToTheSky" for the<br /> Genesis wallet. However, the<br /> account is protected with 2FA.<br /> Can you hack into this renowned<br /> intergalactic wallet and move<br /> their funds to your account?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jy97gy4yan82pix/web_genesis_wallet.zip?dl=0)|[Gelzki](https://github.com/Gelzki/Cyber-Apocalypse-2022-Write-Up/blob/main/Web%20Challenges/Web%20Challenges.md#genesis-wallet)<br>[pich4ya](https://gist.github.com/pich4ya/0db024271327c6abc3a96b986d2c781a)|
|Genesis Wallet's<br /> Revenge|★★★☆|The previous attempts to get<br /> access to the financial operator's<br /> account of the Golden Fang army<br /> failed, and the Genesis platform<br /> went under heavy security<br /> modifications to patch any<br /> potential issues it might have.<br /> Luckily, the operator's credentials<br /> remained the same<br /> "icarus:FlyHighToTheSky". Can<br /> you bypass the 2FA protection<br /> and hack into the wallet account<br /> of that operator to drain his<br /> balance?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dweolarpmkwhkyx/web_genesis_wallet_redemption.zip?dl=0)||
|CheckpointBots|★★★☆|The evergreen Earth was seized<br /> by the nomadic tribes of the<br /> Glowing Sea during the energy<br /> crisis war that turned beautiful<br /> Japan into a war-torn<br /> autonomous region of militarized<br /> activities. Even after Draeger's<br /> defeat, the once proud nation of<br /> Japan was still under the captivity<br /> of the nomadic tribes and is<br /> currently at war with other<br /> regions. At the request of the<br /> Earth liberation front, Ulysses and<br /> the crew decided to help<br /> infiltrate their headquarters in<br /> the Kyoto region. Can you disarm<br /> the Checkpoint bots that roam<br /> around the city of Kyoto?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmyir1x6os8vi6n/web_checkpointbots.zip?dl=0)||

|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|Space Pirate:<br /> Entrypoint|★☆☆☆|D12 is one of Golden Fang's<br /> missile launcher spaceships. Our<br /> mission as space pirates is to<br /> highjack D12, get inside the<br /> control panel room, and access<br /> the missile launcher system. To<br /> achieve our goal, we split the<br /> mission into three parts. In this<br /> part, all we need to do is bypass<br /> the scanning system and open the<br /> gates so that we proceed further.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8girldorupgrufp/pwn_sp_entrypoint.zip?dl=0)|[siunam321](https://github.com/siunam321/CTF-Writeups/tree/main/Cyber-Apocalypse-CTF-2022/Pwn/Space-Pirate:Entrypoint)<br>[skyfr](https://skyfr.notion.site/Space-pirate-Entrypoint-ebd8341824cf40c2ae5f86d6adfab677)<br>[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/entrypoint)|
|Space pirate:<br /> Going Deeper|★☆☆☆|We are inside D12! We bypassed<br /> the scanning system, and now we<br /> are right in front of the Admin<br /> Panel. The problem is that there<br /> are some safety mechanisms<br /> enabled so that not everyone can<br /> access the admin panel and<br /> become the user right below<br /> Draeger. Only a few of his<br /> intergalactic team members have<br /> access there, and they are the<br /> mutants that Draeger trusts. Can<br /> you disable the mechanisms and<br /> take control of the Admin Panel?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jqcewa7fp8se8ge/pwn_sp_going_deeper.zip?dl=0)|[rewdog](https://rewdog.com/ctfs/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/going-deeper)<br>[pizzapablo666](https://pizzapablo666.github.io/Writeups-CyberApo22/)|
|Space pirate:<br /> Retribution|★☆☆☆|We got access to the Admin<br /> Panel! The last part of the mission<br /> is to change the target location of<br /> the missiles. We can probably<br /> target Draeger's HQ or some<br /> other Golden Fang's spaceships.<br /> Draeger's HQ might be out of the<br /> scope for now, but we can<br /> certainly cause significant damage<br /> to his army.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k6f2synfgve5j1y/pwn_sp_retribution.zip?dl=0)||
|Vault-breaker|★☆☆☆|Moneymaker, Big Boy Bonnie has<br /> a crew of his own to do his dirty<br /> jobs. On a tiny little planet a few<br /> lightyears away, a custom-made<br /> vault has been found by his crew.<br /> Something is hidden inside it, can<br /> you find out the way it works and<br /> bring it to Bonnie?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/osynv9ln7hcb8b5/pwn_vault_breaker.zip?dl=0)||
|Fleet Management|★☆☆☆|Reading through an Underground<br /> Intergalactic hacking forum<br /> Bonnie stumbles upon a post<br /> talking about a backdoor in the<br /> Gold Fang’s Spaceship Fleet<br /> Management System. There is a<br /> note about a twist added by the<br /> author to prevent anyone from<br /> using the backdoor. Will Bonnie<br /> achieve to gain access to Gold<br /> Fang’s internal network and<br /> retrieve precious documents?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ftt6c9q1obkutcy/pwn_fleet_management.zip?dl=0)||
|Hellbound|★★☆☆|In one of Bonnie's first missions, a<br /> helpless dog was injured by the<br /> laser guns during the fierce fight<br /> and was unable to move and<br /> escape the war scene. Bonnie<br /> took the dog and fled the battle,<br /> but not much he could do to help<br /> the poor dog. Some of the crew's<br /> doctors and engineers, made<br /> some mutations and added<br /> artificial parts to the dog, making<br /> it a living war machine under<br /> Bonnie's control. After the last<br /> fight, something hit the<br /> manufactured parts, making them<br /> malfunction and driving the dog<br /> berserk. Can you fix them and<br /> make the dog loyal under<br /> Bonnie's control again?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvk3mik7frz8dfi/pwn_hellhound.zip?dl=0)||
|Bon-nie-appetit|★★☆☆|After the successful hijacking of<br /> the D12 spaceship during the<br /> Space Pirate mission, the crew<br /> managed to place a signal<br /> transmitter on a vending machine<br /> that the Golden Fang's members<br /> are using to order food from the<br /> Supplier Spacecraft of Draeger.<br /> Golden Fang's crew's favorite<br /> food contains a secret ingredient<br /> called "Little Green People", which<br /> we do not have further info about.<br /> The signal passes through many<br /> satellites before it reaches the<br /> Supplier, so it won't be easy to<br /> track the device and the leaked<br /> signal. Can you take advantage of<br /> it and get control of the Supplier?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5m5zuqldm1swpwl/pwn_bon_nie_appetit.zip?dl=0)||
|Trick or Deal|★★☆☆|Bonnie and his crew arrive on<br /> planet Longhir to get equipped<br /> with the latest weaponry, but the<br /> intergalactic weapon dealer<br /> refuses to sell them weapons<br /> because he has a trade agreement<br /> with Draeger, the Alien Overlord,<br /> thus Bonnie has to employ his<br /> neat exploitation tricks to<br /> persuade the dealer into selling<br /> them weapons.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dm2kap4rg7s2etk/pwn_trick_or_deal.zip?dl=0)||
|Sabotage|★★★☆|Draeger ordered Thanatos, the<br /> destroyer under the Golden Fang<br /> flag, to annihilate our defense<br /> base with a super laser beam<br /> capable of destroying whole<br /> planets. Bonnie and his crew go<br /> for a sabotage-suicide mission in<br /> order to stop Thanatos before it's<br /> too late.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sfgx6ma40e34hrc/pwn_sabotage.zip?dl=0)||
|Once and for all|★★★☆|This is the final countdown, our<br /> last chance to face the evil galaxy<br /> overlord Draeger. No mistakes are<br /> allowed, we need to give it<br /> everything we have to build the<br /> finest, most powerful weapon<br /> ever made to defeat him. Bonnie<br /> assembled his crew to discuss and<br /> craft it with every resource<br /> possible. Will we manage to make<br /> it?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tt0e6ffdt15lt4j/pwn_once_and_for_all.zip?dl=0)||

|Android-in-the-Middle|★☆☆☆|Years have passed since Miyuki<br /> rescued you from the graveyard.<br /> When Virgil tells you that he needs<br /> your help with something he found<br /> there, desperate thoughts about<br /> your father and the disabilities you<br /> developed due to the disposal<br /> process come to mind. The device<br /> looks like an advanced GPS with AI<br /> capabilities. Riddled with questions<br /> about the past, you are pessimistic<br /> that you could be of any value.<br /> After hours of fiddling and<br /> observing the power traces of this<br /> strange device, you and Virgil<br /> manage to connect to the<br /> debugging interface and write an<br /> interpreter to control the signals.<br /> The protocol looks familiar to you.<br /> Your father always talked about<br /> implementing this scheme in<br /> devices for security reasons. Could<br /> it have been him?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xv26xze9noe7urd/crypto_android-in-the-middle.zip?dl=0)|[kisanakkkkk](https://github.com/kisanakkkkk/writeup/blob/main/Cyber%20Apocalypse%20CTF%202022/Android-in-the-Middle/Android-in-the-Middle.md)<br>[Tell No Tales](https://tellnotales.xyz/posts/ca2022_htb_writeup/#android-in-the-middle)<br>[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#category-challenge-1-android-in-the-middle)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-android-in-the-middle)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooLw4MlgY3w)<br>[an00brektn](https://an00brektn.github.io/htb-cyber-apocalypse-crypto-short-and-sweet/#android-in-the-middle)|
|Jenny From<br /> The Block|★☆☆☆|Intrigued by the fact that you have<br /> found something your father made,<br /> and with much confidence that you<br /> can be useful to the team, you rush<br /> excitedly to integrate “Jenny” into<br /> the spaceship’s main operating<br /> system. For weeks, everything went<br /> smoothly, until you ran into a<br /> meteor storm. Having little to no<br /> data of training, the AI is now<br /> malfunctioning. Ulysses freaks out<br /> because he can no longer control<br /> the spaceship due to the AI<br /> overriding his manual commands.<br /> Big banging noises terrify your crew<br /> members. Everything is shaking. It’s<br /> time to act. Do you think you can<br /> temporarily shut down “Jenny” until<br /> she becomes more sophisticated?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uva8o5gox99h711/crypto_jenny_from_the_block.zip?dl=0)|[Tell No Tales](https://tellnotales.xyz/posts/ca2022_htb_writeup/#jenny-from-the-block)<br>[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-2-jenny-from-the-block)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-jenny-from-the-block)<br>[an00brektn](https://an00brektn.github.io/htb-cyber-apocalypse-crypto-short-and-sweet/#jenny-from-the-block)<br>[kisanakkkkk](https://github.com/kisanakkkkk/writeup/blob/main/Cyber%20Apocalypse%20CTF%202022/Jenny%20From%20The%20Block/Jenny%20From%20The%20Block.md)|
|The Three-Eyed<br /> Oracle|★☆☆☆|Feeling very frustrated for getting<br /> excited about the AI and not<br /> thinking about the possibility of it<br /> malfunctioning, you blame the<br /> encryption of your brain. Feeling<br /> defeated and ashamed to have put<br /> Miyuki, who saved you, in danger,<br /> you slowly walk back to the lab.<br /> More determined than ever to find<br /> out what’s wrong with your brain,<br /> you start poking at one of its chips.<br /> This chip is linked to a decision-<br />making algorithm based on human<br /> intuition. It seems to be encrypted…<br /> but some errors pop up when<br />certain user data is entered. Is there<br /> a way to extract more information<br /> and fix the chip?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6a4smn70yg0yxfm/crypto_the_three-eyed_oracle.zip?dl=0)|[Tell No Tales](https://tellnotales.xyz/posts/ca2022_htb_writeup/#the-three-eyed-oracle)<br>[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-3-the-three-eyed-oracle)<br>[an00brektn](https://an00brektn.github.io/htb-cyber-apocalypse-crypto-three-eyed-oracle/)|
|How The Columns<br /> Have Turned|★☆☆☆|A day before the memorial of the<br /> Dying Sun, Miyuki began talking<br /> about Broider, a death squad<br /> commander and a friend of Paulie’s<br /> capturer. He would be a party guest<br /> at Viryr’s palace. After examining a<br /> lot of different scenarios, Miyuki<br /> came up with a plan in which Paulie<br /> would lure Broider to a secluded<br /> location so the group could capture<br /> him. Following the plan, a wild chase<br /> had just begun when the two looked<br /> each other in the eye. After an<br /> extremely risky maneuver, Paulie<br /> outwitted Broider and led him into<br /> an alley in Vinyr’s undercity. The<br /> plan was a success. Your squad had<br /> managed to capture Broider and<br /> bring him back to the ship. After<br /> hours of interrogation by Ulysses, he<br /> revealed the final key to a series of<br /> encrypted messages. Can you find a<br /> way to decrypt the others? The flag<br /> consists entirely of uppercase<br /> characters and has the form<br /> HTB{SOMETHINGHERE}. You still<br /> have to add the {} yourself.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nrn6804945btuzo/crypto_how_the_columns_have_turned.zip?dl=0)|[Tell No Tales](https://tellnotales.xyz/posts/ca2022_htb_writeup/#how-the-columns-have-turned)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-how-the-columns-have-turned)<br>[C4rm3l0](https://carmelos.medium.com/htb-cyber-apocalypse-22-how-the-columns-have-turned-writeup-c2183b76b71a)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMRIYqm0gxw)<br>[an00brektn](https://an00brektn.github.io/htb-cyber-apocalypse-crypto-short-and-sweet/#how-the-columns-have-turned)|
|MOVs Like Jagger|★★☆☆|While following the breadcrumbs<br /> from the secret messages you<br /> managed to recover from Broider,<br /> Bonnie gathered more information<br /> from his well trusted “Tsirakia” and<br /> found out that the messages were<br /> about the destinations of a STS<br /> (Space Transportation Ship). The<br /> STS, named “Paketo”, is a<br /> notoriously large spaceship that<br /> transports military supplies for the<br /> Golden Fang mercenary army. After<br /> spending some time observing the<br /> seemingly random trajectory of<br /> Paketo, you and Paulie manually<br /> plotted the delivery locations and<br /> realized that the STS’s orbit forms an<br /> elliptic curve. Your spaceship’s<br /> advanced technology GPS has<br /> calculated the exact parameters of<br /> the curve. Can you somehow predict<br /> Paketo’s final destination and hijack<br /> it?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zzbvzlckg6xke3/crypto_movs_like_jagger.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-4-movs-like-jagger)|
|Find Marher's Secret|★★☆☆|After figuring out the destination of<br /> Paketo, Ulysses devised a hijacking<br /> plan to sabotage the delivery of the<br /> military equipment. Despite efforts,<br /> the plan did not work as expected<br /> and a battle ensued. Since your<br /> movement was restricted, Miyuki<br /> ordered you to hide behind a huge<br /> container with unknown contents in<br /> fear of taking more damage. Seeing<br /> all the killings of the manipulated<br /> cyborgs (code named: Marher)<br /> brought back memories of your time<br /> on the graveyard planet.

|Memory Acceleration|★★☆☆|While everyone was asleep, you<br /> were pushing the capabilities of<br /> your technology to the max. Night<br /> after night, you frantically tried to<br /> repair the encrypted parts of your<br /> brain, reversing custom protocols<br /> implemented by your father,<br /> wanting to pinpoint exactly what<br /> damage had been done and<br /> constantly keeping notes because of<br /> your inability of forming new<br /> memories. On one of those nights,<br /> you had a flashback. Your father had<br /> always talked about a new<br /> technology and how it would<br /> change the galaxy. You realized that<br /> he had used it on you. This<br /> technology dealt with a proof of a<br /> work function and decentralized<br /> networks. Along with Virgil’s help,<br /> you had a “Eureka!” moment, but his<br /> approach, brute forcing, meant<br /> draining all your energy. Can you<br /> find a quicker way to validate new<br /> memory blocks?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/01bi7ss1o66w10r/crypto_memory_acceleration.zip?dl=0)|[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-memory-acceleration)|
|Down the Rabinhole|★★☆☆|Miyuki, wanting to find out more<br /> evidence about Draeger and his<br /> escape, planned a space trip to the<br /> maximum security black hole where<br /> Draeger was held captive. Problems<br /> though soon arose as the approach<br /> to the black hole caused distortions<br /> on your electronics. Memories of the<br /> traumatic experience you had when<br /> the Council guards brutally ripped<br /> you from your father’s hands<br /> painfully flooded your mind. The<br /> one thing you never forgot was the<br /> signal he sent you while you were<br /> still within range of the planet. Only<br /> two packets got through, but since<br /> they were encrypted you couldn’t<br /> figure out what they were. Now,<br /> being more determined than ever to<br /> find your father, having gained<br /> experience during the missions with<br /> the squad, you know that it’s time<br /> to decrypt the signal.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zu986hqboi4e82r/crypto_down_the_rabinhole.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-6-down-the-rabin-hole)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-down-the-rabinhole)<br>[Hilbert (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skjKkZ5i8hQ)<br>[chovid99](https://chovid99.github.io/posts/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/#down-the-rabinhole-325-pt)|
|Mind In The Clouds|★★★☆|Mysterious kidnappings of Longhir’s<br /> best scientists began to occur ever<br /> since Draeger gained influence in<br /> the council, a fact known to<br /> everyone in the troupe. Virgil was<br /> certain that these kidnappings had<br /> something to do with Meiro and the<br /> neuro-linked technology he helped<br /> develop. He also knew that Draeger<br /> wanted to experiment by uploading<br /> minds to the cloud and then<br /> connecting them to androids. These<br /> thoughts ran through Miyuki’s mind<br /> while she was searching for clues in<br /> the prison. After finding no signs<br /> that indicated a physical escape, she<br /> concluded that Draeger hadn’t<br /> actually escaped. Instead, he had<br /> somehow initiated a backup version<br /> of his mind, which he had<br /> downloaded into an unknown body.<br /> Upon hearing Miyuki’s conclusions,<br /> the team was in a rather charged<br /> mood. As you sit in the corner,<br /> almost paralyzed by the crippling<br /> news, you can only think of one<br /> thing: Is your father in the cloud/s<br /> too?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8d3y8j1pb0ifupr/crypto_mind_in_the_clouds.zip?dl=0)|[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-mind-in-the-clouds)<br>[chovid99](https://chovid99.github.io/posts/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2022/#mind-in-the-clouds-375-pt)|
|One Step Closer|★★★☆|Reading out loud Danbeer’s<br /> thoughts from the cloud server<br /> shocked everyone. Knowing that<br /> your father has become a<br /> consciousness that can be easily<br /> turned off and on is traumatizing.<br /> You are overwhelmed by your<br /> feelings and angry at yourself. You<br /> begin to ask yourself. Why am I<br /> feeling so much pain? Is there a part<br /> of my brain that is still encrypted?<br /> Have I screwed up again? You run<br /> towards the lab while shouting and<br /> slamming the doors behind you.<br /> Upon seeing that, Ulysses<br /> immediately flees the spaceship.<br /> Many days have passed and you are<br /> still obsessed with finding the part<br /> of your brain that needs to be<br /> repaired. Your comrades are startled<br /> by your sudden introversion and<br /> worry about Ulysses, who is<br /> nowhere to be seen. Weeks have<br /> passed and Ulysses is still missing.<br /> Suddenly, the ship receives a<br /> docking signal and as you scan the<br /> alien spacecraft for signs of life, a<br /> male passenger is discovered. It’s<br /> Ulysses! Excited, he rushes out of his<br /> capsule and overtakes the crew<br /> members, that longed to hug him to<br /> get to your lab. Ulysses informs you<br /> that he has managed to steal one of<br /> the cloud backup servers from the<br /> facility where the experiments took<br /> place. It seems that this device alters<br /> the consciousness of each test<br /> subject. Stunned by this information,<br /> a realization comes to mind. You are<br /> going to get your father back.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhoeklo13u0yzfn/crypto_one_step_closer.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Crypto.md#crypto-challenge-7-one-step-closer)<br>[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#crypto-one-step-closer)|

|Golden<br /> Persistence|★☆☆☆|Emergency! A space station near<br /> Urkir was compromised. Although<br /> Urkir is considered to be the very<br /> embodiment of the neutral state, it<br /> is rich of fuel substances, something<br /> that Dreager is very much interested<br /> in. Thus, there are now fears that the<br /> intergalactic war will also affect this<br /> neutral planet. If Draeger and his<br /> mercenaries manage to maintain<br /> unauthorised access in Urkir's space<br /> station and escalate their privileges,<br /> they will soon be able to activate the<br /> station's defence mechanisms that<br /> are able to prevent any spaceship<br /> from entering Urkir's airspace.

|Free Services|★★☆☆|Intergalactic Federation stated that<br /> it managed to prevent a large-scale<br /> phishing campaign that targeted all<br /> space personnel across the galaxy.<br /> The enemy's goal was to add as<br /> many spaceships to their space-<br />botnet as possible so they can<br /> conduct distributed destruction of<br /> intergalactic services (DDOIS) using<br /> their fleet. Since such a campaign<br /> can be easily detected and<br /> prevented, malicious actors have<br /> changed their tactics. As stated by<br /> officials, a new spear phishing<br /> campaign is underway aiming high<br /> value targets.

This division's goal is to<br /> target any critical infrastructure and<br /> cause financial losses to their<br /> opponents. They never restore the<br /> encrypted files, even if the victim<br /> pays the ransom. This case is the<br /> number one priority for the team at<br /> the moment. Miyuki has seized the<br /> hard-drive of one of the members<br /> and it is believed that inside of<br /> which there may be credentials for<br /> the Ransomware's Dashboard.

|Precious Guidance|★★★☆|Miyuki has come across what seems<br /> to be a suspicious process running<br /> on one of her spaceship's navigation<br /> systems. After investigating the<br /> origin of this process, it seems to<br /> have been initiated by a script called<br /> "SatelliteGuidance.vbs". Eventually,<br /> one of your engineers informs her<br /> that she found this file in the<br /> spaceship's Intergalactic Inbox and<br /> thought it was an interactive guide<br /> for the ship's satellite operations.<br /> She tried to run the file but nothing<br /> happened. You and Miyuki start<br /> analysing it and notice you don't<br /> understand its code... it is<br /> obfuscated! What could it be and<br /> who could be behind its creation?<br /> Use your skills to uncover the truth<br /> behind the obfuscation layers.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nvfhm4kgrdoee6/forensics_precious_guidance.zip?dl=0)|[kevintk1](https://kevintk1.medium.com/cyber-apolcalypse-2022-ctf-ee2c09b43ac#7833)|
|Reflection|★★★☆|You and Miyuki have succeeded in<br /> dis-empowering Draeger's army in<br /> every possible way. Stopped their<br /> fuel-supply plan, arrested their<br /> ransomware gang, prevented<br /> massive phishing campaigns and<br /> understood their tactics and<br /> techniques in depth. Now it is the<br /> time for the final blow. The final<br /> preparations are completed.<br /> Everyone is in their stations waiting<br /> for the signal. This mission can only<br /> be successful if you use the element<br /> of surprise. Thus, the signal must<br /> remain a secret until the end of the<br /> operation. During some last-minute<br /> checks you notice some weird<br /> behaviour in Miyuki's PC. You must<br /> find out if someone managed to<br /> gain access to her PC before it's too<br /> late. If so, the signal must change.<br /> Time is limited and there is no room<br /> for errors.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1t0lqgel01898b/forensics_reflection.zip?dl=0)||

The closest one is<br /> the B1-4S3D station, where we are<br /> unfortunately banned from docking<br /> our ship. Our surveillance showed<br /> that the station uses two OCR<br /> cameras to read the unique ID of<br /> each spaceship entering. The first<br /> one is used as a validator for the<br /> second one. We've managed to find<br /> a way to disable the validation<br /> process for a split second while our<br /> ship passes, but we still need to pass<br /> through the second camera.<br /> Furthermore, our lead hacker<br /> opened a connection with the<br /> second camera, which we can use to<br /> upload our custom model weights.<br /> Try to find a way to change the<br /> predictions of the model when we<br /> pass through the second gate. Be<br /> careful though, the other four<br /> spaceships that are in front of us<br /> need to be ID'd correctly so no<br /> suspicion raises.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ctayubgw9wbkcpw/misc_fuel_crisis.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Misc.md#misc-challenge-1-fuel-crisis)|
|Battle in OrI/On|★★☆☆|The spaceship cruiser has been hit!<br /> Ramona must hurry and check if the<br /> central system is intact! The enemy<br /> must have used electromagnetic<br /> wave canons! The spaceship's<br /> sensors are going crazy and the<br /> autopilot system broke down! There<br /> is no chance to turn back the enemy<br /> will be waiting... But there is a<br /> meteor shower ahead! In order to<br /> get through safely, the spaceship's<br /> power and consumption need to be<br /> balanced. Both the laser canons and<br /> the thrusters are vital parts for this...<br /> And she has to control them<br /> manually! Quickly! Ramona needs to<br /> upload a valid configuration file to<br /> overwrite the values of all sensors<br /> on board. The onboard neural<br /> network will verify that the new<br /> configuration leads to the required<br /> power distribution. Attention! The<br /> values of the sensors must be at<br /> least 99.99% accurate for this to<br /> work! Hurry now, time is running<br /> out!|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/751vvgoiw234gwq/misc_battle_in_orion.zip?dl=0)||
|Quantum Engine|★★☆☆|We need to travel to one of<br /> Draeger's lair in a galaxy far away<br /> from here, to search for any clues<br /> that might help us prove how<br /> Draeger manipulated her to be his<br /> most trustworthy cold-blooded<br /> assassin. However, traveling there<br /> can be quite difficult since it's<br /> flooded with the most state-of-the-<br />art IFGs attack spacecrafts. Should<br /> we be able to outspeed them, we<br /> might have a chance of making it<br /> there in one piece. That is why we<br /> came to you. Word on the solar<br /> system is that you are one of the<br /> best quantum mechanics of the<br /> galaxy, which I find odd considering<br /> your age. Will you be able to modify<br /> Phalcon's acceleration system so no<br /> IFG spacecraft can ever catch us?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y4cvo83hnazlfzr/misc_quantum_engine.zip?dl=0)|[jontay999](https://github.com/jontay999/CTF-writeups/blob/master/HackTheBox/Cyber%20Apocalypse22/Misc.md#misc-challenge-2-quantum-engine)|
|Spaceship Hijack|★★★☆|After the successful mission of<br /> Space Pirate, Bonnie ordered<br /> Ramona to hijack another spaceship<br /> on her own on a stealth mission.<br /> She managed to get inside it and<br /> had limited access to the central<br /> controller. By reverse-engineering<br /> the controller, we figured out that it<br /> uses a unique set of VM instructions<br /> with limited capabilities. Can you<br /> help her break out of this VM and<br /> gain unlimited access?|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xoxnmshmupmbhkk/misc_spaceship_hijack.zip?dl=0)||
|Wormhole<br /> Efficiency|★★★☆|After a severe clash with one of<br /> Golden Fang's battleships,<br /> Ramona's spaceship was damaged,<br /> and now it consumes fuel at the<br /> triple cost. Can you reach home<br /> without running out of fuel? Our<br /> best option is to travel through<br /> wormholes otherwise, the<br /> spaceship will be left wandering<br /> in space and become prey to<br /> Golden Fang's army.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pl2eeejzepdd98r/misc_wormhole_efficiency.zip?dl=0)||

|Space Pulses|★☆☆☆|One of our enhanced radio<br /> telescopes captured some weird<br /> fluctuations from a nearby star. It<br /> was idle for decades due to the<br /> fact that it was fully enclosed by a<br /> Dyson Sphere but its patterns<br /> began to change drastically<br /> leading us to believe that<br /> someone is controlling part of the<br /> megastructure to release energy<br /> and send these pulses directed to<br /> us in order to transmit a message.<br /> They must have known that our<br /> equipment can read even the<br /> slightest fluctuations.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtsv6xuxg9d93xi/hw_space_pulses.zip?dl=0)||
|Through fire n gates|★☆☆☆|After Ramona helped Virgil escape<br /> from the prison they were holding<br /> him they had to find a way to flee<br /> the planet but all the spaceships<br /> were grounded. Luckily they<br /> manage to gain access to a<br /> hangar with decommissioned<br /> escape pods. After some tinkering<br /> with the pod's control panel, they<br /> managed to attach some probes<br /> to it and reverse engineer the<br /> proprietary protection circuit but<br /> some of it appears to be<br /> damaged. The only thing holding<br /> them back was finding a way to<br /> gain access to the flight control<br /> system.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/orvc9b22t5y8ijk/hw_through_fire_n_gates.zip?dl=0)||
|Into the Matrix|★★☆☆|After a long time away it is finally<br /> time to get back all the equipment<br /> build all those years. While going<br /> through the hardware devices to<br /> reconfigure or upgrade them one<br /> of them seemed a bit off. It<br /> appears that someone was toying<br /> with a few of the devices,<br /> changing and breaking the hard-<br />wired components which resulted<br /> in some of them malfunctioning.<br /> The status matrix in one of the<br /> armor-enhancing weapons seems<br /> to display random indications<br /> making the weapon selection<br /> system unusable. This, combined<br /> with the fact that most of the<br /> circuitry is now under a hard<br /> epoxy resin makes it impossible<br /> to reconfigure the hardware<br /> connection, thus the only solution<br /> is to reverse engineer the current<br /> device layout and add an<br /> additional circuitry that will work<br /> around the current one.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pgu9dq5d10y1hge/hw_into_the_matrix.zip?dl=0)||
|Secret Codes	|★★☆☆|A sudden burst of RF signals<br /> started in an attempt to<br /> compromise our perimeter<br /> security. We intercepted a few of<br /> them but our ADC broke during<br /> the transformation to a serial<br /> signal leaving us with only an<br /> analog capture. We need to<br /> decode it and find if they are<br /> close to finding the correct<br /> passcode.|[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1a3ewydf7133jq/hw_secret_codes.zip?dl=0)|[willwam845](https://willwam.me/posts/2022-05-19-htb-cyberapocalypse-2022#hardware-secret-codes)|
