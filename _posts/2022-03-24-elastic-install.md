I've messed with installation of Elastic using Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) with AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). But I have never tried a manual install on a server. These are the instructions I ran to get Elasticsearch and Kibana up and running with HTTPS enabled between Kibana and our browser. Personally I think I would prefer setting up Elastic with Docker, and perhaps I'll add to this guide to include Docker installation later. But for now I just wanted to try a bare metal install of an Elastic Stack. To mimic installing, configuring, and accessing an Elastic Stack on a server via a cloud provider or anywhere really, I thought it would be beneficial to setup my own server on a VM to test the waters. If you would like to follow along with the Ubuntu Server, you can follow the guide I created [here](https://gore-ez-knee.github.io/posts/ubuntu-server-setup/)



These are the guides I used to help set this up:
- <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html>
- <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/deb.html>
- <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/master/secure-connections.html#generate-fleet-server-certs>

## **Elasticsearch**
First thing's first, we'll update and upgrade all of the packages on Ubuntu Server:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
```

With this being Ubuntu, we'll install using debian packages:

```
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.1.1-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-8.1.1-amd64.deb
```

The output here is important. You'll want to make sure you copy and paste this somewhere for reference. It has reference commands to change the superuser password and generating enrollment tokens for Kibana and Elasticsearch. It also contains the built-in elastic superuser password.

If you would like to ensure that Elasticsearch starts automatically when the system boots:
```
sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
```

To start the Elasticsearch service, run:
```
sudo /bin/systemctl start elasticsearch.service
```

Open up a second terminal window on your host and attempt to `curl` the Elasticsearch service using the VMs IP and replace `PASSWORD` with the password given in the security configuration output when Elasticsearch was installed. You should see a similar output:
```
$ curl -k -u "elastic:PASSWORD" https://192.168.235.129:9200
{
  "name" : "elastic",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "hagNR9aLTLaXk-TQkBnt9w",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.1.1",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "deb",
    "build_hash" : "d0925dd6f22e07b935750420a3155db6e5c58381",
    "build_date" : "2022-03-17T22:01:32.658689558Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.0.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

Now we'll generate an enrollment token for Kibana. You can reference the security configuration output when we installed Elasticsearch for the command:
```
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
```

Copy the output and save it for use in the next couple of steps.

## **Kibana**

Download and install the Kibana debian package:
```
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-8.1.1-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i kibana-8.1.1-amd64.deb
```

Now run the next command, pasting in the enrollment token when prompted:

```
$ sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-setup
? Enter enrollment token: <Enrollemnet Token String>

âœ” Kibana configured successfully.

To start Kibana run:
  bin/kibana
```

To have Kibana configured to run at startup:
```
sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable kibana.service
```

Before we start Kibana, we need to configure a few things first. First we need to create some self-signed certs to enable HTTPS between Kibana and our browser, then configure `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` to relect those changes.

To generate self-signed certs using the elasticsearch-certutil binary, run the following. You may choose to add a password to your certificate file:
```
sudo /user/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert -name kibana-certs --self-signed
```

For my preference I am going to create a `certs` directory in `/etc/kibana`, move the certificate file there, then give ownership of the certs to `kibana`. That last command is very important:
```
sudo mkdir /etc/kibana/certs && sudo mv /usr/share/elasticsearch/kibana-certs.p12 /etc/kibana/ce
rts && sudo chown -R kibana: /etc/kibana/certs
```

Now we'll update `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`. Add the following:
```yaml
server.host: 0.0.0.0
server.ssl.enabled: true
server.ssl.keystore.path: "/etc/kibana/certs/kibana-certs.p12"
# If you didn't give your keystore a passphrase uncomment the next line
#server.ssl.keystore.password: ""
```

If you added a password to your certificate, add it to kibana's keystore:
```
sudo /usr/share/kibana/kibana-keystore add server.ssl.keystore.password
```

We also want to secure the saved objects that are stored in Kibana such as dashboards, visualizations, alerts, actions, and advanced settings. These objects might include sensitive information. To add a layer of protection to these saved objects (which are kept in a dedicated, internal index), we'll use the `kibana-encryption-keys` binary to generate keys for us to place inside of `kibana.yml`.

If you would like to setup key rotation as well, you can follow Elastics [Kibana Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-security-secure-saved-objects.html).

```
sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-encryption-keys generate -f | tail -4 | sudo tee -a /etc/kibana/kibana.yml &>/dev/null
```

Finally we'll start Kibana
```
sudo /bin/systemctl start kibana.service
```

If everything worked correctly, you can open up a browser on your host and type in `https://SERVER_IP:5601`. You should be greeted with a "Your connection is not secure" warning. That's okay, because these are self-signed certificates that you created. Accept the risk and proceed to starting out with Elastic!

We can sign in with user `elastic` and the password given to us from the security configuration output when we installed Elasticsearch.

## **Fleet Server**

Download and install the Elastic Agent Debian package:
```
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.1.1-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i elastic-agent-8.1.1-amd64.deb
```

Now we'll follow [this guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/master/secure-connections.html#generate-fleet-server-certs) to setup TLS communication with the fleet server. Elastic Agents require a PEM formatted certificate so we'll start off with creating a CA for our fleet server certificates:
```
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil -s ca \
--pem --out /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca.zip
sudo unzip -q /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca.zip -d /etc/elasticsearch/certs/
sudo rm /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca.zip
```

> If you need to install unzip, run `sudo apt install unzip`
{: .prompt-info }

With CA certificates, we can create certificates for our fleet server:
```
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert -s \
--name fleet-server --ca-cert /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca/ca.crt \
--ca-key /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca/ca.key \
--out /etc/elastic-agent/certs/fleet-server.zip --pem
sudo unzip /etc/elastic-agent/certs/fleet-server.zip -d /etc/elastic-agent/certs/ &>/dev/null
sudo rm /etc/elastic-agent/certs/fleet-server.zip
```

Next let's login to Kibana and under `Management`, click on `Fleet`

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip22.png)

There will be a page with steps showing how to add a Fleet Server. They're pretty straight forward, but will need a bit of modification. Right now, there are no fleet server policies. So on Step 1, be sure to click on `Create Policy`. If you would like to change what logs the agent will collect, you can select/deselect `Collect system logs and metrics` and/or under `Advanced options -> Agent monitoring` you can select/deselect `Collect agent logs` and `Collect agent metrics.`

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip23.png)

Ignore Step 2, because we have already downloaded and installed Elastic Agent

On Step 3, we'll choose the `Quick start` deployment type.
On Step 4, since our Fleet Server will be installed on the same server as our stack, we'll use our server IP as our Fleet Server host (https://SERVER_IP:8220). Be sure to click `Add host`.
On Step 5, click `Generate service token`

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip24.png)

Now we come to the last step. Here's where we'll change a few things. We'll need to add our certificates we created for our Fleet Server. And since this is a Debian package installation of Elastic Agent, we'll need to use `enroll` instead of `install` and we'll have to manually start the Elastic Agent after the Agent enrolls.

Here is the template to enroll the agent:
```
sudo elastic-agent enroll -f \
--url=https://192.168.235.130:8220 \
--fleet-server-es=https://192.168.235.130:9200 \
--fleet-server-service-token=AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE2NDg0MDQ5MjQ0OTg6cWRjN0lLNWZTaDJJbnVkb0NWTTgzQQ \
--fleet-server-policy=fleet-server-policy \
--fleet-server-es-ca-trusted-fingerprint=dd9d32e7c53bbc30c56a740db3752c01db7545d5bb9c8e951fc446747994192c \
--certificate-authorities=/etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca/ca.crt \
--fleet-server-cert=/etc/elastic-agent/certs/fleet-server/fleet-server.crt \
--fleet-server-cert-key=/etc/elastic-agent/certs/fleet-server/fleet-server.key
```
Step 6 provides the necessary info for the variables (SERVER_IP, FLEET_SERVICE_TOKEN, and ELASTICSEARCH_CA_FINGERPRINT) that need replacing. If you have followed the guide exactly so far, the certificate and keys should be in same place.

Replace the needed values and paste the command into the server where Agent is installed and run it.

You should see a message that reads `Elastic Agent has been enrolled`. If you see that, now all that needs to happen is to start the Agent:
```
sudo service elastic-agent start
```

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip25.png)

If we go back to Kibana, we should see that the Fleet Server has connected. Click continue and now we can view our Agent(s)!

## **Elastic Agent**

With our Fleet Server up and running, we can now install Agents on systems we want to monitor and have them managed by our Fleet Server. For this Example, I'm going to test this on a Windows 11 VM. You can download an image here: <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/>. Just remember to ensure that the Network is configured for NAT just like the Ubuntu Server if you're following along with Ubuntu Server setup.

I would also like to try out the Network Packet Capture integration, which for Windows requires `npcap` to be installed. Then we'll also need to install packetbeat. Here is a list that needs to be installed:

|File|Link|
|---|---|
|Elastic Agent|https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.1.1-windows-x86_64.zip|
|Npcap|https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.60.exe|
|Packetbeat|https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-8.1.1-windows-x86_64.zip<br>https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-8.1.1-windows-x86_64.zip.sha512<br>https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/packetbeat/packetbeat-8.1.1-windows-x86_64.zip.asc|

First we'll install Npcap on Windows. Install it with all of the selected defaults. Keep hitting Next until it finishes.

Our Agent will need a policy to enroll in. Then we can add integrations to that policy. In Kibana go back to Fleet and click on `Agent policies` then `Create agent policy`

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip28.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip29.png)

Give the policy a name and click `Create agent policy`.

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip30.png)

Once the policy is created, click on the policy name then click `Add integration`

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip31.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip32.png)

The integrations I'd like to add are the Endpoint Security as well as the Network Packet Capture. Endpoint Security should be at the top of the integration page. Click on it then click `Add Endpoint Security`

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip33.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip34.png)

In Step 1 give the Integration a name. In Step 2, make sure that the tab `Existing hosts` is selected and the policy that we created is selected in `Agent policy`. Then click `Save and continue`

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip35.png)

You'll be prompted to `Add Elastic Agent to your hosts`, but we still need to add another integration. Select `Add Elastic Agent later`. Follow the same steps to add the `Network Packet Capture` integration. You can get back to integrations selecting it under `Management` right above `Fleet` or the big blue button that appears at the bottom of the sidebar.

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip36.png)

In the search bar, type `Network Packet Capture` and add the integration to our policy. 

Now we can go ahead and `Add Elastic Agent to your hosts` here, or we can go back to our Fleet and add an agent there.

In Step 1, make sure our policy with Endpoint Security and Network Packet Capture is selected. Ignore Step 2. In Step 3, Select Windows. 

Before we copy and paste the command into Windows, we need to extract the contents of the elastic-agent zip file we downloaded. Then we need to copy and paste the three Packetbeat files we downloaded and paste them into the the newly extracted folder `elastic-agent-8.1.1-windows-x86_64\data\elastic-agent-7f30bb\downloads\`

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip41.png)

Then we need to open a PowerShell or Cmd window with Administrator privileges. Navigate inside of the extracted `elastic-agent-8.1.1-windows-x86_64\` directory. There should be an `elastic-agent.exe` executable there. Then we can copy and paste the command from Kibana.

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip38.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip37.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip39.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip40.png)

We'll need to add a `--insecure` at the end of the command to enroll the Agent and to avoid an untrusted certificate error since these certs are self-signed.

If everything enrolled correctly, you should see the output:
```
Successfully enrolled the Elastic Agent.
Elastic Agent has been successfully installed.
```

Then in Kibana we should see our new, healthy Agent

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip42.png)

Now if we head over to Security in Kibana, we can check out Host and Network activity. Then we can load prebuilt Elastic rules under `Detect` and enable them.

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip45.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip43.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip44.png)

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip46.png)

There are also some prebuilt Dashboard you can use to visualize the data coming in.

![](/assets/img/post_images/elastic_install/snip47.png)

## **All-In-One Script Install**

<https://github.com/gore-ez-knee/awesome-scripts/tree/main/elastic-quickstart-bare-metal>

If you would like to setup up a single stack quick and painlessly, I threw all of the commands into a script. Being that I installed this on a Debian/Ubuntu server, the script has been setup to install **Debian packages only**. Also this only works for Elastic version 8.0.0+ because Elastic v8 automatically creates TLS certificates for Elasticsearch communication and I haven't put checks in to create and update Elasticsearch should someone want to install an older version. 

The script requires that some `sudo` commands be ran. This is for enabling services to autostart as well as modifying `/etc` files.

It also generates self-signed certificates to enable TLS between Kibana and one's browser as well as for Fleet Server.

If you'd like to choose a different architecture, you can manually modify the `elastic_package`, `kibana_package`, and `agent_package` variables at the beginning of the script and choose option `4`.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Default packages to install if no version is selected.
# If another architecture type is needed, you can change these names to what you need.
# https://elastic.co/downloads/past-releases
elastic_package="elasticsearch-8.1.1-amd64.deb"
kibana_package="kibana-8.1.1-amd64.deb"
agent_package="elastic-agent-8.1.1-amd64.deb"
...
```


When ran, the output should look similiar to this:
```
elastic-user@elastic:~$ sudo ./elastic_stack.sh
[sudo] password for elastic-user:
Select a number corresponding to the version you'd like to download:

[*] Once you have entered the command and the Agent shutsdown, start the agent:

```

To change the superuser password or generate enrollement tokens to add additional Elasticsearch nodes, the script outputs the initial config output to the file `elasticsearch_install.out` which gives the needed commands.
