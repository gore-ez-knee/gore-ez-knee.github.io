Just a small site to show progress in what I've learned and document things I've done. I don't claim to be an expert in anything. I enjoy trying things, failing, and learning from them. I'm open to feedback if anyone sees something that goes against best practice or can be done better and more efficiently. If you have found value in anything that I've posted, give me a follow on LinkedIn or Twitter :D
